# render-template

`{{render-template 'template string' vars}}` is used to interpolate some dynamic
variables into a string and produce a string output as a result i.e. a micro,
regex based, template engine. For example:

```hbs preview-template
<figure>
  {{render-template 'http://localhost/?service=${Service.Name}&datacenter=${Datacenter}'
    (hash
      Datacenter="dc1"
      Service=(hash
        Name="Hello-Service"
      )
    )
  }}
  <figcaption>^ that is the rendered template</figcaption>
</figure>

```

Additionally the variables passed into the template are automatically URL
encoded as our primary usecase for this is for creating dynamic links/URLs. If
we ever need to reuse this without URL encoding, then an option could be added
as a named argument to disable/turn that off. In which case, encode should be
default and a knob provided to turn it off (at the time of writing our primary
usecase is to encode).

Should we ever need to support (or turn support off for) different interpolation
separators, then and option could be added also.

Currently supported separators are javascript style `${VariableName}`
(preferred) and mustache style `{{VariableName}}` (deprecated but maintained for
back compat reasons). If you ever need to use this internally (i.e. not a user
facing template then please use the JS style).

**Please note:** Our `uri` helper (that is used extensively in the UI) also uses
some of the underlying functionality of `render-template` via our `encoder`
service. Since we upgraded `render-template` to use JS style syntax, the `uri`
helper is almost the same as `render-template` and could potententially be made
into just a semantic alias of the `render-template` helper (and we could delete
some repetitive code and take advantage of the more complete test coverage
:ta-da:). (If this ever gets done, even if you see that it has been and a docs
amendment was missed, please update these docs, ty!)
